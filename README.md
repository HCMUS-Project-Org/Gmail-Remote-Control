## About the project

### Introduction:

Program to control remote computer by email, in which:

-  **The user** (client) sends an email (containing requests to be made by the server) to the server's email (server).
-  **The server** reads the incoming email, performs the tasks the client sends and sends the results back to the client by replying to the client's email.

### Technology:

-  **Framework:** Flask
-  **Backend:** Python
-  **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5

### Features

**Client application:** A web GUI app to control remote computer, in which:

-  Login with google account.
-  Send email to server.
-  Get and show reply email from server.
-  View detail and download attached files.

**Server application:**

-  Key logger: Get keystrokes from keyboard.
-  Shutdown/logout:
   -  Shutdown computer.
   -  Logout computer.
-  MAC address: Get computer's MAC address.
-  Save screenshot.
-  Capture webcam image.
-  Directory tree:
   -  List all files in a directory.
   -  Copy files to client computer.
   -  Copy files to server computer.
   -  Delete files.
-  App process:
   -  List processes.
   -  List applications.
   -  Kill processes.
   -  Start applications.
-  Registry:
   -  Get registry value.
   -  Set registry value.
   -  Create registry key.
   -  Delete registry key.

## Getting start

### Prerequisites

-  Python `>= 3.10.7`
-  Client environment variables:

   -  **Environment:** add file `.env` in `/Client`, `.env` config:

      -  `SECRET_KEY`: a key used by Flask to encrypt and sign session data.
      -  `PORT`: specify which port the Flask application should listen on.
      -  `SERVER_EMAIL`: the email address of the server, which is received email from client

      Example:

      ```bash
      # .env
      SECRET_KEY = "RemoteControlByEmail-HCMUS"
      PORT = 3000
      SERVER_EMAIL = "server@example.com"
      ```

   -  **Credentials:** get Gmail API credentials file by [Gmail API instruction](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python#authorize_credentials_for_a_desktop_application) then add file `credentials.json` in `/Client`

      Example:

      ```json
      // credentials.json
      {
      	"installed": {
      		"client_id": "client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com",
      		"project_id": "gmail-remote-control",
      		"auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
      		"token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
      		"auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
      		"client_secret": "client_secret",
      		"redirect_uris": ["http://localhost"]
      	}
      }
      ```

### Run locally

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HCMUS-Project/Gmail-Remote-Control.git
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
cd Gmail-Remote-Control
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the server:

```bash
python Server/server.py
```

The server will run on port 5656 and with host 0.0.0.0

Start the client:

```bash
python Client/client
```

The client will run on PORT which define in `.env` file and with host:

-  Running on http://127.0.0.1:[PORT]
-  Running on http://192.168.133.135:[PORT]
